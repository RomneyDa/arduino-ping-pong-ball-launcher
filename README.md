Some preliminary results are shown in the PingPongCompetitionResults document

Essentially, this code was used to process an image to produce a list of target coordinates, which were then passed to a robot that used a solenoid to launch the balls at the targets. The robot was programmed using arduino and used simple physics and numerical methods to determine the necessary power to hit the target.
